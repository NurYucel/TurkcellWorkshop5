### You want to write a play. We are planning to develop the backend codes for this software with JAVA. New members, sales and campaign management are required.

### Requirements:
1. Simulate an environment where players can register to the system, update their information, and delete their registrations. We want to verify the accuracy of customer information using e-government systems. (Verification in e-government systems is done with TcNo, Name, Surname, Year of Birth. It is enough to simulate the service that will do this.) (Like logging)
2. Simulate the sales environment where the game can be sold.
3. Simulate the possibilities of entering a new campaign into the system, deleting and updating the campaign.
4. Simulate campaign integration in sales.
